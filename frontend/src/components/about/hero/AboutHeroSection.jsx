      question: "What tech stack do you use?",
      answer: "MERN Stack, MongoDB's BSON data format lets me store almost anything I need, and communicating with it via Express and Node is straightforward. Reactâ€™s hooks, state management, and routing make building dynamic applications simple and efficient.",

      id: 5,
      question: "Are you studying anything new?",
